\chapter{Representation Theory $SU(2)$ for spin-2 systems}
\section{Invariant $G$-modules}
Consider a vector space $V$ as an invariant left $G$-module which transforms under the fundamental representation of $G\cong SU(2)$. $V^*$ will denoted the conjugate of $V$. Through tensor products of these vector spaces, we can construct higher dimensional vector spaces which will transform with higher dimensional representations of $SU(2)$. We can find the dimensions of these representations using \textit{Young tableu}. 

\section{Young tableu}
The \textit{defining representation} will be denoted by a box: $\Box$. The dimension of the $V$ in the defining representation of $SU(2)$ is $2$. Taking the tensor product of $V$ with itself, produces higher dimensional Young tableu. Suppose the vector space, $W = V\otimes V$, has two invariant subspaces.
